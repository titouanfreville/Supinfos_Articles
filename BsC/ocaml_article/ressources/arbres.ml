This is NOT in the COURSES of supinfo. OCAML is a child of lisp develop by INRA (french ;))
Consult documentation for more information :) http://caml.inria.fr/
CAML is a HARD TYPED LANGAGE, type constructor help to create type so you can match more things ;)
   CAML will always take the SMALLEST RESTRICTION type when prototyping the function
ALl the function are tested with SUBLIME REPL on linux (ocaml package install)
*)

(* CAML is a strong typed language, wich mean that you can't manipulate trees as list unlike LISP
We need to create tree types (thought some types of tree are already include in CAML (search them on google ;) )
*)
(* Let's Define the binary tree type. Binary tree are tree who can only accept 2 child by nodes like the first
one presented*)
type 'a  tree = E | L of 'a | N of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree;;
(* type : constructor for new type
 'a : mean an unkow type (but need to be fix in the tree created
 tree : name of the type
 | : separator for the different Value of a tree
 here : a 'a tree is a tree that is E (Empty) or L (Leaf) of 'a type, or N (Node) of 'a tree,'a,'a tree *)
(* To build the tree in the exemple, we'll need another type who can mix operators && numbers. Let's call it :
expression *)
type expression = O of (int -> int -> int) | I of int;;

let t_course = N(N(L(I(4)),O( * ),L(I(3))),O(+),N(L(I(5)),O( * ),L(I(2))));;
let t_course_printable = N(N(L("4"),"*",L("3")),"+",N(L("5"),"*",L("2")));;


(* Now, let's play with it :) *)
(* Let's build the tree using Graphicals ;*)
(* Add graphics :) *)
(* The following functions are helpfull when working on tree as you see quickly what is going wrong.
Need to be adapted to your structure but is a good basics. *)

(* @EFFECTS: draw the tree t from (x,y) point with first step h (steps height diveded by 2 each time) *)
